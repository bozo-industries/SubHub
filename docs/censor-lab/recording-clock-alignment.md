# Recording clocks and native analysis dependencies

Android screenrecord output is variable-frame-rate. Average FPS is not an exact mapping from
frame index to screenshot timestamps. Prefer validated Winscope timing metadata when present;
scripts/screenrecord_timestamps.py accepts version2 and requires one unique metadata payload,
valid size/count, and increasing timestamps. Compare the metadata count to every decoded frame
before matching indexes. Keep elapsed, uptime and wall clocks distinct and report clock-fit spread
and nearest-frame error. An accepted nearest timestamp does not prove identical compositor content.

Accessibility screenshot timestamps are not automatically pixel timestamps. In Android15,
window results are stamped on client receipt in [AccessibilityInteractionClient](https://github.com/aosp-mirror/platform_frameworks_base/blob/android-15.0.0_r1/core/java/android/view/accessibility/AccessibilityInteractionClient.java#L1354),
and display results on server completion. Keep request, reported, callback and verified pixel time
separate. Never promote receipt-time visual measurements into exact camera anchors or subtract a
fixed offset without source evidence. In the current service, captureAgeMs is request-to-publication
latency; audit the producer/call site rather than inferring pixel age from that legacy field name.

The authoritative format implementation is Android's [screenrecord source](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/av/+/b675cea85b508d7f60f1344e5a24c3db7a5b8d0f/cmds/screenrecord/screenrecord.cpp).
Its version2 frame count is uint32 in code despite the nearby prose describing eight bytes.
FFmpeg may discard zero-duration metadata tracks and produce empty data exports with exit0. Verify
nonempty output and expected structure; do not infer successful extraction from the exit status.

For optical intervals hundreds of milliseconds apart, direct sparse flow may choose a wrong match
despite reporting many features. Inspect disagreement frames; sum adjacent-frame flow when useful
and reject intervals with missing edges. Never silently turn failed optical steps into zero motion.

Use a Python interpreter matching the native dependencies' ABI. The existing calibration-python
packages contain cp312 modules; PATH Python can change and must not be assumed compatible. Discover
the bundled Python runtime, verify its version, and set a task-local PYTHONPATH to the analysis
packages. Do not replace global NumPy/OpenCV installations to repair a mismatched interpreter.

When validating decode through FFmpeg's null output, preserve a sufficiently fine output timebase
(for example, `-fps_mode passthrough -enc_time_base 1:90000` with FFmpeg 7.1). A coarse inferred
output timebase can emit duplicate/non-monotonic DTS warnings for otherwise distinct decoded
frames. Check source timing metadata and decoded count independently before treating a null-sink
timestamp warning as source corruption; never repair it by silently dropping source frames.

OpenCV `CAP_PROP_POS_MSEC` can return an invalid timestamp for the first decoded frame even
when later values agree with the media timestamps. Validate the first timestamp and critical
transition indexes independently with FFmpeg `-copyts`, `select`, and `showinfo`. Do not shift
every frame to compensate for a first-frame anomaly, or infer transition duration from average
FPS. Record the discrepancy and use independently verified timestamps for reported events.
